### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics covered in our labs provided a solid foundation for completing the assignment, particularly in understanding the core functionalities and design principles. However, I felt somewhat unprepared when it came to implementing real-time event handling and integrating external APIs, which required deeper technical knowledge and troubleshooting skills.
* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Given more time, I would have focused on refining the user interface for better usability and aesthetics. Additionally, I would have liked to explore incorporating machine learning algorithms to enhance predictive capabilities, which could have added significant value to the project's functionality.


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During the project demo, the implementation of data validation and error handling went smoothly, which showcased our attention to detail in handling various scenarios. However, we encountered unexpected latency issues during live data streaming, which impacted the overall demonstration flow. I noticed that a peer effectively utilized a feedback loop mechanism to improve user interaction, which I aim to integrate into future projects for enhanced user engagement and satisfaction.
